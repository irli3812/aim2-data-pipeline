function stats = ar_irls_Mixed( d,X,Z,Pmax,tune )
% See the following for the related publication: 
% http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756568/
%
% d is matrix containing the data; each column is a channel of data
%
% X is the regression/design matrix
%
% Pmax is the maximum AR model order that you want to consider. A
% purely speculative guess is that the average model order is
% approximatley equal to the 2-3 times the sampling rate, so setting Pmax 
% to 4 or 5 times the sampling rate should work fine.  The code does not
% suffer a hugeperformance hit by using a higher Pmax; however, the number
% of time points used to estimate the AR model will be 
% "# of time points - Pmax", so don't set Pmax too high.
%
% "tune" is the tuning constant used for Tukey's bisquare function during
% iterative reweighted least squares. The default value is 4.685.
% Decreasing "tune" will make the regression less sensitive to outliers,
% but at the expense of performance (statistical efficiency) when data 
% does not have outliers. For reference, the values of tune for 85, 90,
% and 95% statistical efficiency are
%
% tune = 4.685 --> 95%
% tune = 4.00  --> ~90%
% tune = 3.55  --> ~85%
%
% I have not tested these to find an optimal value for the "average" NIRS
% dataset; however, 4.685 was used in the published simulations and worked
% quite well even with a high degree of motion artifacts from children.
% If you really want to adjust it, you could use the above values as a
% guideline.
%
% DO NOT preprocess your data with a low pass filter.
% The algorithm is trying to transform the residual to create a
% white spectrum.  If part of the spectrum is missing due to low pass
% filtering, the AR coefficients will be unstable.  High pass filtering
% may be ok, but I suggest putting orthogonal polynomials (e.g. Legendre) 
% or low frequency discrete cosine terms directly into the design matrix
% (e.g. from spm_dctmtx.m from SPM).  Don't use regular polynomials
% (e.g. 1 t t^2 t^3 t^4 ...) as this can result in a poorly conditioned
% design matrix.
%
% If you choose to resample your data to a lower sampling frequency,
% makes sure to choose an appropriate cutoff frequency so that that the
% resulting time series is not missing part of the frequency spectrum
% (up to the Nyquist bandwidth).  The code should work fine on 10-30 Hz
% data.
