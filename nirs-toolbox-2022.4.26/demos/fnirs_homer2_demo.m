%% This is a demo to show how to import *.nirs data from the HOMER-2 format 
% The HOMER-2 format uses the field "CondNames" and the "s" variable to
% define stim timing, which differs from the StimDesign or stimulus
% Dictionary formats used in this tool box.  Namely, the HOMER-2 format does not 
% specify duration or amplitude information which is needed for the GLM
% model and so these needs to be added.

% Data (in the HOMER-2) format is loaded in the same way
raw = nirs.io.loadDirectory(fullfile(root_dir,'SampleData',demo),{});
% The load function will use the 's' variable and the CondNames to define
% the stimulus info.  
% If the "s" variable is blocked (e.g. s channel is 1 for the entire
% duration of the stim rather then just the onset), then the duration will
% be fine and the next step can be skipped.  Otherwise (e.g. only the onsets are denoted),
% we have to change the duration from a delta function (single point) to the 
% duration of the task.

% In this file, the stim marks were not preprocessed, so the code read the
% timing from the "s" field and used a default name (stim_condition1)

% This function will extract all the stim info from the data variable
stimTable=nirs.createStimulusTable(raw);
disp(stimTable);

% The height of this table matches the length of the "raw" data field.
% The first column denotes the FileIdx.
% The FileIdx is used to match the stiminfo to the data.  This allows us to
% modifiy each file individually, only certain files (if you remove all but 
% these rows from the table), or modifiy all the stim conditions together.
% We use "NaN" as a wildcard varible.  Thus, if FileIdx=NaN, this entry
% will be applied to all the files.  

% The entries in the table for each condition are either type
% nirs.design.StimulusEvents or nirs.design.StimVector;
%
% nirs.design.StimulusEvents - denote indidual events and have the fields
%      name: - the name of the condition
%     onset: - a vector of onset times (in seconds)
%       dur: - a vector of durations for each event
%       amp: - the amplitude of each event (used in parametric designs)
%
% In this notation, the duration for eact trial can be independently set.
% If a scalar (single value) is given for either amp or dur, then it is
% assumed that all trials have the same value (and differ only in onset time).
%
% nirs.design.StimulusVector- denotes a continious regressor and has the fields
%       name: - the name of the condition
%     vector: - a vector of amplitudes (per time)
%       time: - the time vector for the samples.
%
%  Note- The spline-interp function is used to resample the vector onto the data
%  when creating the design matrix





% To chabge the timing of stimulus events you modify the entry of the
% stimTable using NaN as placeholds to indicate keeping the old values

% Option #1 (the more complete but harder way)

% E.g to change the duration of the events to 10s but keep the onsets as
% defined by the data import function 

% This will cut off all but the first entry of the table
stimTable(2:end,:)=[];  
stimTable.FileIdx=NaN;  % If we set the FileIdx to NaN then it will apply to all files.
% This is a short-cut which does the same as leaving the entire table
% intact and changing every entry seperately.  If we left this as
% FileIdx=1, then our change would only be applied to the first file

st=stimTable.stim_channel1;

st.onset=NaN;
st.dur=10; % But let's change the duration to 10s for all trials

stimTable.stim_channel1=st;  % Using NaN will keep the original timing.  Again, if we left the 
% values as real values (which in this case correspond to the first file),
% then it will replace all the times (and potentially mess up files 2 and
% beyond).  

% To implement the changes, we use the ChangeStimulusInfo job
j = nirs.modules.ChangeStimulusInfo();
j.ChangeTable = stimTable;

% Now, run the actual job
rawChanged = j.run(raw);


% Option #2.
%alternatively, if you only need to change the durations, this is a utility
%to do so
rawChanged=nirs.design.change_stimulus_duration(raw,'stim_channel1',10);





% if we draw it, we can see the changes
% either by
figure;
rawChanged(1).draw;
% or using the nirsviewer GUI
% >> nirs.viz.nirsviewer;

% Now, let's run an analysis on this

% Create the pipeline (this is the most basic pipeline possible)
j = nirs.modules.OpticalDensity();
j = nirs.modules.BeerLambertLaw(j);
j = nirs.modules.AR_IRLS(j);

% Let's use a FIR model to show how to do deconvolution
 FIRbasis=nirs.design.basis.FIR;

% FIRbasis = 
%   FIR with properties:
%     nbins: 10  - number of bins in the HRF 
%     binwidth: 5 - number of time-points per bin

% Currently our sample rate is 10Hz (=raw(1).Fs)
% Thus, binwidth =5 corresponds to a 0.5s bin
% The nbins =10 tells us the window will be 0.5s x 10 = 5s wide, which is not
% wide enough.  Note, this is for the estimation of the impulse response
% function (so the response is convolved with whatever the stimulus
% duration is).  Let's make the width 15s by setting nbins =30
FIRbasis.binwidth=5;
FIRbasis.nbins=30;

j.basis('default')=FIRbasis;

SubjStats = j.run(rawChanged);
% Note, SubjStats now has 240 betas (8 channels x 30 betas per condition)
% If we used SubjStats.draw() it would draw 30 images (one per time point in the HRF)

% This funciton will create the HRF data from the basis set.  This function
% also needs to know the duration of the event (default = impulse response)
% and the sample rate.

% extract the HRF response
HRF = SubjStats.HRF();

% This is a core.Data object so we can draw it (or load it in
% nirs.viz.nirsviewer
figure;
HRF.draw();
j = nirs.modules.OpticalDensity();
j = nirs.modules.BeerLambertLaw(j);
j = nirs.modules.AR_IRLS(j);

% Option 1
c = zeros(1,30);
c(1,[2:8])=1;  % Set the contrast from 1s-4s (remember this the impulse response not the HRF per se). 

% Option 2
% alternatively, you can specifiy contrast like this
c = 'stim_channel1[2:8]';  % 2-8th time point (at sample rate)

% Option 3
c ='stim_channel1[3:6s]';  % 3-6seconds

% Option 4
c = 'stim_channel1[canonical]';  % use a canonical tapered window

Contrast = SubjStats.ttest(c);
