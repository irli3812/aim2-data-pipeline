% This is a simplified version of the image reconstruction.
% This code uses the ApproxSlab forward model, which is a simplified
% approximation (but really fast) to the diffusion model based on two
% oblique semi-infinite slab geometries.  This forward model is not
% "terrible" for quick displays but I might be cautious to use it in publications


% Let's first just make up some data
raw = nirs.testing.simData;

% note, there is also a funciton called
% nirs.testing.simDataImage and 
% nirs.testing.simData_registered which generate data using a registered
% probe from a specific anatomical region

% since we used a simulate function that wasn't registered, let's register
% it to the 10-20 system.  Also see the toolbox/dmeos/registration_demo.m
% example.

% let's just center this on the forehead
Name{1}='FpZ';
xyz(1,:)=[0 0 0];
Type{1}='FID-anchor';  % This is an anchor point
Units{1}='mm';

Name{2}='Cz';
xyz(2,:)=[0 100 0];
Type{2}='FID-attractor';  % This is an attractor
Units{2}='mm';

Name{3}='T7';
xyz(3,:)=[-200 0 0];
Type{3}='FID-attractor';  % This is an attractor
Units{3}='mm';

Name{4}='T8';
xyz(4,:)=[200 0 0];
Type{4}='FID-attractor';  % This is an attractor
Units{4}='mm';

% The definition of anchors and attractors are similar to the notation used
% in AtlasViewer.  An anchor will fix this point on the probe to the same
% point on the head.  When more then one anchor is specified, the placement
% will follow a least-squares positioning.  There must be at least one
% anchor specified for registration.  An attractor is a point that "points
% in the direction of <>" and is used to create orientation of the probe.  
% In this example, the first attractor points at Cz (top of head) and is up 
% (positive Y direction) in the probe (points to [0,100,0]).  The value of 100
% is somewhat arbitrary as long as it is pointing in the right direction.
% Unlike AtlasViewer, I don't have you specifiy connections from these anchors 
% to the optodes.  I use the nearest 3 points to each anchor to define connections.  

% now we need to add these points to the optodes field in the probe.  This
% is a table, so we need to create a matching format table with the
% fiducials
fid=table(Name',xyz(:,1),xyz(:,2),xyz(:,3),Type',Units',...
    'VariableNames',{'Name','X','Y','Z','Type','Units'});
% and concatinate it to the probe
raw.probe.optodes=[raw.probe.optodes; fid];
% NOTE- these fiducials are automatically imported from the AtlasViewer
% format when you use the command nirs.util.sd2probe


% because I can, let's adjust the probe to the size of a child at 43cm head
% circumference instead of using the large head of Colin27
headsize=Dictionary();
headsize('circumference')=430;  %mm

%This is the command to actually register the probe to the head.
raw.probe=nirs.util.registerprobe1020(raw.probe,headsize);

% use to visualize
raw.probe.draw1020
% % or 
% raw.probe.defaultdrawfcn='10-20';
% raw.probe.draw;

% this loads the pre-made Colin27 atlas mesh
mesh=nirs.registration.Colin27.mesh;

% by default, the mesh will draw the fiducial points when plotting.  This
% is controlled in the mesh(1).fiducials field.  To turn off all of the
% 10-20 labels
mesh(1).fiducials.Draw(:)=false;   
% the mesh is also nested (4-layers), so let's turn off the display of the
% skin, skull, and dura
mesh(1).transparency=0;
mesh(2).transparency=0;
mesh(3).transparency=0;

% and registers it to the probe.  Note, this registers the mesh to the
% probe, not the other way around, which means that since our probe was
% created for a 43cm head circumference, we are shrinking Colin27 down to match our probe.
raw.probe=raw.probe.register_mesh2probe(mesh);

% change the default draw behavior and show the results
figure;
raw.probe.defaultdrawfcn='3D mesh (frontal)';
raw.probe.draw;   %you should see the brain with the probe overlain

% let's just skip through all the basic analysis (there are other demos for
% that) and use one of the default jobs.  (Note, there is a default
% pipeline for image_reconstruction too)

% IMPORTANT: Because the input to image recon needs to be Optical Density
% and not hemoglobin, we need to skip the MBLL step.  Use the _dOD pipeline
% which does this.  
job=nirs.modules.default_modules.single_subject_dOD;
SubjStats=job.run(raw);


% Because the probe was registered to the raw data, everything derived from
% that data is also registered, so the SubjStats will display on the brain
% as well. Note, you could have done all the analysis and then used the
% SubjStats.probe to do all the registration steps above as well.  

SubjStats.draw('tstat',[],'p<0.05');



% Ok, now lets do a basic image reconstruction
job = nirs.modules.ImageReconMFX;

%There is alot of fields to this job because it actually does BOTH image
%reconstruction and group-level analysis.  See the citations for the job

job.cite;   % all jobs/pipelines store the citation info (in case you haven't found that yet).

Jacobian = ApproxSlab.jacobian('spectral');  % get the jacobian with spectral priors

job.jacobian('default')=Jacobian;   % The jacobian and probe fields are dictionaries and can be used
