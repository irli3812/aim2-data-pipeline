%% load data
% this function loads a whole directory of .nirs files. The second argument 
% tells the function to use the first level of folder names to specify 
% group id and to use the second for subject id.
raw = nirs.io.loadDirectory([root_dir filesep 'demo_data' filesep 'data'], {'group', 'subject'});

% The load directory function will load *.nirs data files based on hierarchical folder information.  
% The second argument in the function describes how to interpret this hierarchical information.
% Example 1:
%      <root folder> / <Group 1> /
%                                   <subject A>/ files.nirs

%                                   <subject D>/ files.nirs
%
% the full path to <root folder> should be first input.  The second input should be {'group','subject'}.  
% This will result in the data being organized into two groups with two subjects per group.
%
% Example 2:
%      <root folder> / <Group 1> /
%                                   <subject A>/ <Session 1> / files.nirs

%
% the full path to <root folder> should be first input.  The second input should be {'group','subject','session'}.  
% This will result in the data being organized into two groups with two subjects per group and two sessions per subject.
% 
% The group/subject/etc labels are aribitrary (e.g. you can name them
% whatever you wish) but define the demographics information avaliable for
% the later group-level ANOVA and mixed effects models.  

% You can view the demographics information for your data by typing:
demographics = nirs.createDemographicsTable(raw);
% This information is stored in the new Matlab table class (see Matlab
% "help table").  This data can be displayed in a formated message 
% >> disp(demographics);  

% This should show two columns (for the 68 data files provided)
%    group    subject
%     _____    _______
%     'G1'     'S11'  
%     'G1'     'S12'

%% The nirs.core.Data structure.
% The data (now contained in the variable "raw") is contained within a
% Matlab class definition that we have created.  A Class is an object that
% may contain both public (accessible to other programs) and private (internal) variables and methods.
% The matlab command "methods(raw)" or methods(nirs.core.Data) will display
% a list of the methods that this class can use.  For the Data class, these
% methods include draw() and a number of variables.
% For example, the command "raw(1).draw()" will evoke the drawing routine for the first data file.  
%
% The "raw" variable is an array of class nirs.core.Data.  This allows
% array operations to be preformed.
% E.g.  raw(2)=[];  would remove the 2nd data file (and shift the entries
% down);
%       raw = [dataset1 dataset2];  would concatinate two data sets.  

% The first data file looks like this:
% % >> raw(1)
% ans = 
%   Data with properties:
%      description: '/Users/lab/Desktop/tmp/data/G1/S11/scan.nirs'
%             data: [3505x70 double]
%            probe: [1x1 nirs.core.Probe]
%             time: [3505x1 double]
%               Fm: 0
%         stimulus: [1x1 Dictionary]
%     demographics: [1x1 Dictionary]
%               Fs: 10

%  The data class itself contains subclasses (e.g. Dictionary and nirs.core.Probe) 
%  that will be explained later in this tutorial.  This file has 3501 time points sampled at Fs=10Hz.  
% It's a CW-NIRS measurement (e.g. Fm =0).  There are 70 channels of data.

%% The nirs.core.Probe class
% The probe class describes the probe layout and measurement info for the
% 70 channels.
%
% raw(1).probe
% ans = 
%   Probe with properties:
% 
%        srcPos: [12x3 double]
%        detPos: [14x3 double]
%          link: [70x3 table]
%     distances: [70x1 double]

% The srcPos and detPos are the [X.Y.Z] location of the source and
% detectors used for drawing
% probe.distances is a read-only field that is automatically calculated
% from the src/det positions
% probe.link is a Matlab table class (just like the demographics variable
% above).  
% probe.link in this example will look like this:
%    source    detector    type
%     ______    ________    ____
%      1         1          690 
%      1         1          830 
%      1         2          690 
%      1         2          830 
%      1         6          690 
%      1         6          830 

%% The Dictionary class
% The Dictionary class is a book-keeping method that we invented for this
% toolbox.  Basically, a Dictionary object is an array that is indexed by a
% name (string) instead of a subscript.
%  E.g. 
%  MyDictionary = Dictionary();  % Create an empty dictionary
%  MyDictionary('Some Name') = 1;
%  MyDictionary('Some Other Name') = 2;  % Stores data into two entries
%  disp(MyDictionary('Some Other Name')); % --> displays "2" to the screen.


% Since there are 68 subjects in this data set, this analysis could take a
% bit of time depending on your computer.  You are welcome to try to
% analyze the whole data set, but let's prune out a bit so this runs a lot
% faster
raw = raw(1:4:end);
% This will keep only every 4th subject


%% preprocessing pipeline
% The nirs-toolbox is based on creating and running jobs to do the
% analysis. Jobs can be run one at a time or concatinated and run all at once.
% This list of jobs is defined in nirs.modules.* (type "help(nirs.modules)"
% for matlab help on this.

% Let's create an analysis pipeline.
% The first job is always intialized with an empty argument
% For our first job, lets run a routine to remove any files that aren't
% going to be used in the statistical model. 

% You can remove junk files, such as setup files here.  Any file without
% a stimulus design will be removed (e.g. resting state or files collected
% when setting the probe on the subject before the study began)
j = nirs.modules.RemoveStimless( );
% This is a simple job that doesn't take any arguments.  Showing this in
% matlab displays:
% >> disp(j)
%       RemoveStimless with properties:
%            name: 'Remove Files w/o Stim'
%            prevJob: []

% At this point, we could just run the job using the command:
% >> raw_pruned = j.run(raw);  
% But, instead, lets add more functionality to the job and run it all at
% once later.

% Now, lets add a second step/job to the pipeline by chaining the jobs together
% This is done by feeding the current job in as the argument when creating
% a new job.  E.g. new job  = nirs.modules.<job name>( previous job); 

% This module can be used to rename and/or merge stimulus conditions
% together. 
j = nirs.modules.RenameStims( j );
% This job contains a field called "listOfChanges" 
% which specifies the changes we are going to make to the stimulus names;  

% The matlab command:
% >> unique(nirs.getStimNames(raw));  % will show a list of all the unique names
% of stimulus events in the raw data.  
% You can see there are two conditions "A" & "B" right now.  Let's change
% the names to "X" and "Y" instead to show how.
j.listOfChanges = {
    'A', 'X'; 
    'B', 'Y'};
% Now when we run the job, the condition names will be changed.
% Likewise, this would merge the two conditions into a single condition
% j.listOfChanges = {
%     'A', 'X'; 
%     'B', 'X'};

% There are also jobs:
%  nirs.modules.DiscardStims - removes a set of conditions
%  nirs.modules.KeepStims - removes all except a set of conditions

% Note- these steps do not touch the original data files.  If you reloaded
% the raw data files, you would have to start renaming all over again


% Now, let's try some processing.  The next step will be to resample the
% data. 
% If the data is sampled at a very high sampling frequency, resampling to
% around 4 or 5 Hz will speed up the regressions which run line O(N^2). It's recommended that you
% choose a new sampling rate that you choose a new sampling frequency such
% that old_fs / new_fs is an integer (e.g. 20 Hz -> 5 Hz).
j = nirs.modules.Resample( j );
j.Fs = 2;  % Sets the new sample rate to 2Hz (was 10Hz).  Usuaully, I would leave the sample rate
% at 4Hz or above, but for the purposes of allowing this demo to run
% quickly, let's use 2Hz.

% Many times you can have files excessive baselines before the start or at
% the end of an experiment for various reasons.  Here we can trim the data
% so that there is a max of 30 seconds of pre and post baseline.  This will
% cut off the time points earlier then 30s before the first stim event in the data and 30s AFTER the last stim event.
j = nirs.modules.TrimBaseline( j );
j.preBaseline  = 30;
j.postBaseline = 30;
% or j.postBaseline = []; would keep all the data AFTER the last stim event
% and only discard the pre-event times.


% Before doing regression we must convert to optical density and then
% hemoglobin.  The two modules must be done in order.
j = nirs.modules.OpticalDensity( j );

% Convert to hemoglobin.
j = nirs.modules.BeerLambertLaw( j );


% Finally, run the pipeline on the raw data and save to anew variable.
% This will run through all the steps we just created and output the
% processed nirs.core.Data class (which is now hemoglobin since the MBLL
% was now run);
hb = j.run( raw );
% This new data variable is the same class as the raw variable and has the
% same methods and fields.  But, now we can see that this stores hemoglobin
% If we look in the probe.link field, the type is now hbo & hbr
% >>disp(hb(1).probe.link)
%     source    detector    type 
%     ______    ________    _____
%      1         1          'hbo'
%      1         1          'hbr'
%      1         2          'hbo'
%      1         2          'hbr'
%      1         6          'hbo'


%% check data for QA
% Here you can click through the files and also click on the probe to see
% specific channels.
% >> nirs.viz.TimeSeriesViewer( hb );  % This function will show the GUI to see the hb data

% Alternatively, we can use the command:
% >> hb(1).draw();  to display just the furst file


%% subject level pipeline

% Now, let's start a new job and run the GLM model 

% This is the recommended first-level GLM module.
j = nirs.modules.GLM();  % remember, creating a job with no input will start a new job.  
% We could have just kept adding the the old job if we had wanted to
% We can see that this job has a number of fields
%  disp(j)
%   AR_IRLS with properties:
%          basis: [1x1 Dictionary]  -- This field describes the canonical or deconvolution model
%        verbose: 1  -- This is a flag to display more info to the screen
%     trend_func: @nirs.design.trend.constant  -- This field describes trend regressors
%           name: 'GLM via AR(P)-IRLS'
%        prevJob: []
       

%%%% (OPTIONAL) This turns on optional progress output.
j.verbose = true;

%%%% (OPTIONAL) The temporal model must include trend regressors, such as 
% DCT terms or polynomials.  At the very least, a constant regressor must be 
% returned, which is set by default.
% The j.trend_func field is a function handle which inputs a time vector
% There are several options for this which are stored under
% nirs.design.trend.*

% This is a function of t that returns a third order polynomial trend terms.
% >> j.trend_func = @(t) nirs.design.trend.legendre(t, 3);

% This example specifies DCT terms with a frequency cutoff of 0.08.
j.trend_func = @(t) nirs.design.trend.dctmtx(t, 0.08);

% This example returns only a constant.  You could also just use a 0th
% order polynomial as above.
% >> j.trend_func = @nirs.design.trend.constant;

%Let's use the DCT regressor for now;
% typing >> "plot(j.trend_func([0:60]'));"  will plot the DCT for
% time=0-60s

%%%% (OPTIONAL) A temporal basis can be specified. The Canonical HRF basis
% used by default.
j.basis = Dictionary();

% the default basis will be used if no other basis is specified
j.basis('default') = nirs.design.basis.Canonical();

% optionally, you can specify a different basis for each condition
j.basis('X') = nirs.design.basis.Canonical();
j.basis('Y') = nirs.design.basis.Canonical();

% other bases included nirs.design.basis.*
% nirs.design.basis.BoxCar();  -- This is a simple box car based on the stim timing
% nirs.design.basis.FIR();  -- This is the finite-impulse response (or
%                              deconvolution model).
% nirs.design.basis.GAMMA();  -- This is the SPM gamma function 

% Run the analysis.  This could take some time if your computer is terribly slow.  
% If you want, you can go back up and change the sample rate to 1Hz in the
% resample function and it should run 25x faster.
SubjStats = j.run( hb );
% I am running this job on the hemoglobin variable, but I could have also
% done so on any nirs.core.Data variable (e.g. optical density)

% The output of this pipeline is now a new data class called
% nirs.core.ChannelStats.  This is a class which stores the SPM model
% information including all the covariance information needed to do the
% group level stats, any secondary T-stats or contrasts, image
% reconstruction, and region-of-interest definitions.

%% The nirs.core.ChannelStats class
% This data class 
% >> disp(SubjStats(1))
%   ChannelStats with properties:
% 
%      description: '/Users/lab/Desktop/tmp/data/G1/S11/scan.nirs'
%        variables: [140x4 table]
%             beta: [140x1 double]    - The GLM model coefficients
%             covb: [140x140 double]  - The full covariance of the coefficients
%              dfe: 116               - Degrees-of-freedom in the model
%            probe: [1x1 nirs.core.Probe] -  The same probe as used in the data class
%     demographics: [1x1 Dictionary]
%       conditions: {2x1 cell}      - The names of the conditions (X & Y)
%            tstat: [140x1 double]  - The tstatistics on the betas 
%                p: [140x1 double]  - p-value for the t-test
%                q: [140x1 double]  - q-value (FDR) for the t-test



% When we first entered the data using the load function, we used the
% folder structure to define groups, subjects, etc.  These define
% demographics variables which are used for group-level mixed effects or
% ANOVA models (either in channel space or for image reconstruction).  We 
% already showed how this demographic data could be displayed using the command
%
% >> disp(nirs.createDemographicsTable(<NIRS Data class>));
% 
% This demographic infomation can also be specificed inside the *.nirs
% files themselves (see documentation on the *.nirs format). Demographics can be 
% either catagorical (like "group") or valued (like age or clinical scale) Finally, we
% can load/add additional demographics information directly from the
% command line tools.  

% To add demographics information, we use the following job:
j = nirs.modules.AddDemographics();
% This job contains a field (demoTable) that is used to populate the
% demographics.  This can be programatically or simply read from a CSV file
%
% In the demo data, we provide a CSV file with demographics info.
j.demoTable = readtable( [root_dir filesep 'demo_data' filesep 'data' filesep 'demographics.csv'] );

% We are going to match the subject column in the above table
j.varToMatch = 'subject';  
% Note "subject" (or whatever you are matching based on) needs to be an
% entry in BOTH the CSV file and the nirs.core.<> class that you are
% loading the demographics to.  

% This is a job, so we need to run it like the others.  In this case, let's
% run the job on the SubjStats variable we just created.  We could, of
% course, have ran this job earlier on the raw data
SubjStats = j.run(SubjStats);

% Just like before, we can check the demographics by using
disp(nirs.createDemographicsTable( SubjStats ));
% and we can see that a new column called "age"
% Note, we just made this information up for the purpose of this demo
%
%     group    subject    age
%     _____    _______    ___ 
%     'G1'     'S11'       28
%     'G1'     'S12'       72
%     'G1'     'S13'       99
%     'G1'     'S15'        4
%     'G1'     'S17'       99
%     'G1'     'S19'       62
%     'G1'     'S22'      100
    
% The ChannelStats class has an entry per file, so right now we should have 68 
% entries.  These are the stats for each of the files from the raw data.
% Just like the nirs.core.Data class, the ChannelStats class is an array
% and can be concatinated or deleted using sub-indexing.  
% 
% You could the data in batches and later concatinate the files such as:
% >> StatsAll = [Stats_from_year1 Stats_from_year2];  
% Thus, you wouldn't need to rerun the analysis as new subjects are added.
%
% The ChannelStats class has a draw function (similar to the data class)
% To draw the data, you use the command:
SubjStats(1).draw('tstat', [-10 10], 'p < 0.05');
% You should get 4 images for conditions X & Y and HbO2 & Hb
% Note, you have to tell the index (1 in this case) because the data is an
% array.
%  This notation used in the draw command will display the T-stat (other options are "F-stat" and
%  "beta").  This will scale from -10 to 10 and will only show data for
%  p<0.05.  
%  
% The ChannelStats variable can be used to run t-tests to create different
% contrats (e.g. condition A vs B), but we will show some more examples of this in a little bit.

%% Group level
% Now, let's run the group level model to combine the 68 files.
% This module computes group level statistics using a mixed effects model.
j = nirs.modules.MixedEffects( );

% We must specify the formula for the mixed effects.  This one calculates
% the group mean for each condition.  There is also a random intercept for
% each subject.  Google "matlab wilkinson notation" or see
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/wilkinson-notation.html> for more examples.
j.formula = 'beta ~ -1 + group:cond + (1|subject)';
% In this case, we will obtain a total of 4 images (x2 for oxy- and
% deoxy-Hb) because group and condition are being considers.  
%  Condition X - For Group G1
%  Condition X - For Group G2
%  Condition Y - For Group G1
%  Condition Y - For Group G2

% Here we must specify the encoding for categorical variables, such as
% group and condition.  Options are 'full', 'reference', 'effects'. 
j.dummyCoding = 'full';

% We could also add demographics to the model, such as age, gender, etc.
j.formula = 'beta ~ -1 + group:cond + age + (1|subject)';
j.include_diagnostics=true;
% In this case, I will have 5 images.  In addition to the 4 above, I will
% also have a map of channels that are significantly explianed by the age
% cofactor

% Run the group level. This could take awhile depending on your computer.
GroupStats = j.run(SubjStats);
% The output of this is anouther ChannelStats class variable (just like our
% previous SubjStats).  

%% vizualization
% We can look at the results like below.  This tells it to draw the probe
% using tstat values, showing a range of -10 to 10 and using p < 0.05 as
% the criteria for statistical significance.
GroupStats.draw('tstat', [-10 10], 'p < 0.05')

% You can also use false discovery rate for stat significance
GroupStats.draw('tstat', [-10 10], 'q < 0.05')

% If you want to know the critical value you can use
GroupStats.getCritT('q < 0.05')
% Q is the false-discovery rate (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate> )

% You can also display a table of all stats
disp(GroupStats.table());
% This is a big table structure, but you can pull all the beta, tstats, etc
% from this table (see matlab >>help table) for information on this class

%% Contrasts
% We are usually interested in differences between groups or conditions.
% First, look at what the conditions (regression variables) are:
disp(GroupStats.conditions);
% We can see that there are five contasts.

% Next, specify a contrast vector
c = [0 1 0 -1 0];
% This means we want to contrast the 2nd (Y:group1) and 4th (Y:group1)
% conditions.  

% or we can specify a bunch of contrasts:
c = [eye(5);  % all 5 of the original variables
    0 1 0 -1 0; % X - Y for group 1
    0 0 1 0 -1; % X - Y for group 2
    0 1 -1 0 0; % G1 - G2 for X
    0 0 0 1 -1]; % G1 - G2 for Y

% Calculate stats with the ttest function
ContrastStats = GroupStats.ttest(c);

%% Saving and loading variables
% All the classes above are matlab variables and can be saved and loaded just like any other 
% matlab variables.  Note however, that because they use special data
% classes that are defined by the toolbox (e.g. +nirs namespace) the
% toolbox needs to be in the path to reload the saved variables.
